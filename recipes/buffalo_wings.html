                <li>1 tablespoons sherry vinegar or white vinegar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>

              <h2>Steps</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Cut 3 pounds of chicken wings into 3 sections; 
                    save the wing tips for stock. Toss the wings with 
                    a little neutral oil to keep them from sticking.</li><br>

                <li>Heat a charcoal or gas grill; the fire should be
                    moderately hot and the rack 4 to 6 inches from the heat. 
                    Leave one side of the grill cooler for indirect cooking.</li><br>

                <li>Put the wings on the cool side of the grill. 
                    Cover the grill and cook, checking and turning once or twice,
                    until most of the fat has been rendered and the wings are cooked 
                    through, 15 to 20 minutes.(You can also broil in the oven on a sheet pan, 
                    flipping wings halfway through.)</li><br>

                <li>While the wings cook, combine 1/3 cup relatively mild hot sauce,
                    4 tablespoons melted butter, 1 tablespoon sherry vinegar or white vinegar, 
                    1 tablespoon minced garlic, salt and pepper in a large bowl.</li><br>

                <li>When the wings are cooked, add them to the bowl with the sauce, 
                    and toss to coat. Now put the wings on the hot part of the grill and cook, 
                    uncovered, turning as necessary, until theyâ€™re nicely browned on both sides. 
                    (Or return to the broiler for a few minutes.)</li>
              </ol>
